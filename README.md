# Running

To run the app, navigate to `/server` and run `npm install`, then do the same for the `/client` folder.

After that, navigate back to the root of the project, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. This will start
both the API server and the client server.

After that you can go to `localhost:5173` in your browser to view the app.
